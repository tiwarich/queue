# Queue Implementation in C

This C program demonstrates a basic implementation of a queue data structure using an array. A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

## Features

- Initialize an empty queue.
- Enqueue an element into the queue.
- Dequeue an element from the queue.
- Peek at the front element without removing it.
- Check if the queue is empty.
- Check if the queue is full (based on a maximum capacity).

## Code Structure

- `main.c`: The main program that demonstrates the queue implementation.
- `queue.h`: Header file defining the queue structure and function prototypes.
- `queue.c`: Source file containing the queue implementation functions.
